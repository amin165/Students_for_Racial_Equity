<h1>BRIGHT CS</h1> 
<p>This project was started by Kimi and Amina in an effort to equalize the school system</p>
<p>Many students are unaware of the inequality present in the APS community due to its presence in everyday life</p> 
<p>We designed this project to make these inequalities public and available for everyone to witness and possibly make better</p> 
<p>Here we will make known the opportunities that APS has been keeping away from families of APS that are economically-disadvantaged or families where their first language is not English</p>
