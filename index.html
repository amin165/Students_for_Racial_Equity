<p style= "color: black;font-size: 24px;font-family: didot;">
Founded in 2020 in response to the racial unjustice of George Floyd's death, we strive to bring equity to the Arlington Public School system. We conduct "empathy interviews in order to gain a different perspective on how racism in present in APS. We use this information from students to conduct teacher development sessions where they will get to hear input from their students. This was help to promote a more mindful attitude and promote anti-racist action in APS teachers and school system. 

We also inform students of the variety of opporunities that are available to them because we know that being an English-learner or a student of color makes it harder to become informed of the different opportunities that they have. Having parents that may not speak English makes the search for opportunities even harder since the information about these different opportunities are usually given to the parents.
