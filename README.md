# Students for Racial Equity (SRE)

A website dedicated to creating a welcoming and inclusive APS school system. We inform students of color and English-learners of opportunities available to them. We conduct "empathy interviews" with students to gain perspective on different people's lives in order to strengthen our teacher development sessions. With their students preferences and beliefs, we think that we can help make APS a more racially equitable county. 

We are planning on starting a podcast on Arlington Independent Media (AIM) so that our ideas and conversations are more easily accessible to everyone.
